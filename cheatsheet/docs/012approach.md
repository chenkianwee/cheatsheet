# Getting Things Done
“If a craftsman wishes to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools.” （工欲善其事，必先利其器）

## Approaching a Project 
Envision your goal so that you never lose sight of it. An example from experience when starting a research project. When you have an idea. Envision the final deliverables for the project.
1. When writing the proposal for the project, envision the number of papers/reports you are going to publish from the project.
2. When writing each paper, have a clear objective for the paper, and write the abstract, introduction and literature review section of the paper before doing any experiment/modeling.
3. When working on the experiment/modeling exercise for the paper be clear about what data you need to collect for the paper.
4. When collecting data from the experiment/modeling be clear about what you want to find and how it will be visualize and presented in your paper.
5. When visualizing and presenting the data be clear how the data is proving the objective.
6. When proving the objective be clear about how it contirbutes to the project.

### Opensource business model
- indicators for an open source project 
1. Is there a community that contributes and support your open source product: e.g. github stars, number of contributors
2. Is there a need for your open source product: e.g. number of downloads for your product, usage number of your product
3. If both (1) and (2) what is the value your company can bring to the users of your product.
4. There are 3 main business model
    - provide support and service for your open source product: e.g. redhat -> their biz is strong capability to deliver services and support whenever you need them.
    - Software as a service (SaaS): e.g. TimescaleDB, provide hosting and make it much easier for your users to use your software
    - Open core and provide paid features: e.g. cesiumJS 

## Teaching digital AEC through the computational approach
You need students to have knowledge on all of these 3 area
- Models: 
    - Data Models: BIM, GIS, Brick Schema, OpenStudio Model, Control Description Language (CDL)
    - Simulation Models: EnergyPlus, Radiance
- Domain Expertise: Architecture, MEP Engineering 
- Programing: explore the models with ease

## Different level of computational design practice/research
1. Data structures and algorithms: study and development of the most efficient data structure and algorithms to perform the required task.
2. Software development: as no existing software solution satisfy your requirements, you develop your own software solution to achieve the task.
3. Information technology: using the appropriate existing software to achieve the task.

## Running a small business
### Simple accounting
- to create a stable monthly income for your small biz
- You need 3 accts
    - operational: where all your revenue goes to
    - tax: 30% of the revenue goes here to pay taxes
    - basic salary: your own basic salary. The basic salary == revenue you hit at least 75% of the time
- once your operational acct has at least a two months baseline you can consider increasing your basic salary etc.

### Passive income for consultancy
- course on my expertise, launch it on udemy
- content, tutorials -> sell ads on this website
- sell tools and content -> data pack, donation for tools
