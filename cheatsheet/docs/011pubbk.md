# Jupyter-book

This is written to guide you through publishing your book online with jupyter-book and hosting it on github. I wrote this guide as an exercise for me to get familiar with the jupyter-book library. At the same time it serves a note for myself. This guide is based on information from [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) for more information please refer to the link. This section provides step by step guide to publish your book. I will start with the installation requirement. I am using a Windows machine for executing the steps, if you are using either a Linux or MacOS machine, there might be slight differences to the result. Please refer to the [original guide](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) if you run into any issue with your machine.
