## Reality Capture
### Photogrammetry
- Article about photogrammetry software (https://all3dp.com/2/best-free-photogrammetry-software/)
- Conclusion
    - It is not useful for capturing room. Rooms have bland walls, which make feature detection difficult (https://github.com/alicevision/Meshroom/issues/2144).
    - Need a 3d lidar scanner for scanning room.
        - the use of Ipad or iphone could be a viable solution (https://canvas.io/#pricing)
        - most low-cost off-the-shelf 3d scanners are developed for scanning benchscale products

            - https://store.creality.com/products/cr-scan-ferret-3d-scanner?spm=..404.header_1.1
        - Overview of 3dscanners on the market (https://www.3dsourced.com/rankings/best-3d-scanner/)
        - roomscale scanners quickly become very expensive >USD 5000

- Software that I have tried:
    - Meshroom (https://alicevision.org/#meshroom), the most matured and well-supported open-source photogrammetry software. However, it does not have a MacOS version.
        - https://meshroom-manual.readthedocs.io/en/bibtex1/test/test.html
    - visualSFM (http://ccwu.me/vsfm/index.html) - not allowed for commercial use.
        - http://ccwu.me/vsfm/doc.html#usage
    - OpenCV Python (https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) both of the tutorials below are not working anymore.

    - https://github.com/micmacIGN/micmac
- Related software
    - https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D â€“ uses rgbd images (need realsense camera) for reconstruction.
