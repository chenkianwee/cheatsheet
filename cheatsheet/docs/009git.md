look at all the branches locally, the branch with * is your current branch
```
git branch
```

switch to a branch
```
git switch branch-name
```

create a branch
```
git branch branch-name
```

delete a branch
```
git branch -d branch-name

```

delete a branch remotely
```

## reset a commit
use log to check all the commit
```

## create a gh-pages branch

1. create a gh-pages branch
```
git branch gh-pages
```

2. remove all the git files to make sure only the build files will be in the gh-pages branch
```
git rm -rf .
```

3. copy all the files from the your jupyter-book folder into this branch. Or if you have set it to be ignore on the main branch, do not ignore it here
```
cp -r jupyter_book_folder .
``` 

4. add all the files to the commit. Make sure to add the .gitignore file to ignore files you are not committing.
```
git add .

git commit -m "message for your commit"
```

5. add the deploy jupyter-book workflow into the folder .github/workflows/deploy_book.yml
```
name: deploy-book

# Run this when the master or main branch changes
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - gh-pages
    # If your git repository has the Jupyter Book within some-subfolder next to
    # unrelated files, you can make this run only if a file within that specific
    # folder has been modified.
    #
    # paths:
    # - user_manual/**

# This job installs dependencies, builds the book, and pushes it to `gh-pages`
jobs:
  deploy-book:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Install dependencies
    - name: Set up Python 3.12
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'
        cache: pip # Implicitly uses requirements.txt for cache key

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r user_manual/requirements.txt

    # (optional) Cache your executed notebooks between runs
    # if you have config:
    # execute:
    #   execute_notebooks: cache
    - name: cache executed notebooks
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: _build/.jupyter_cache
        key: jupyter-book-cache-${{ hashFiles('user_manual/requirements.txt') }}

    # Build the book
    - name: Build the book
      run: |
        jupyter-book build user_manual/

    # Upload the book's HTML as an artifact
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: "user_manual/_build/html"

    # Deploy the book's HTML to GitHub Pages
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

6. push the branch to the remote branch
```
git push -u origin gh-pages
```

6. configure the gh-pages setting to deploy from workflow 


## Git sync branch with main
- how to git sync branch with main: https://graphite.dev/guides/how-to-sync-git-branch-with-main

1. fetch the latest change
```
git fetch origin
```

2. checkout the branch
```
git checkout your-feature-branch
```

3. rebase feature branch to main
```
git rebase origin/main
```

4. If there are any conflicts, Git will pause the rebase process and prompt you to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, continue the rebase with:
```
git rebase --continue
```

5. push the rebased branch to remote
```
git push -f origin your-feature-branch
```

## Github
So that you do not need to type your token in everytime you push, store your git credentials with this https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git
```
gh auth login
```
